**Repository:**  https://github.com/kmgilland/GILLAND-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app 


### 📈 **2. Tidy Data Cleaning and Analysis** 
**Description:**  This project cleans up a dataset containing U.S. federal research and development (R&D) funding across various departments from 1976 to 2017, as well as GDP values for each year. After tidy data is achieved, visualizations are added to show various trends in the data.  
**Skills Used:**  Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplot, Seaborn  
**Repository:**  https://github.com/kmgilland/GILLAND-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project


### 🧠  **3. Named Entity Recognition Streamlit App**  
**Description:**  This Streamlit app allows users to explore Named Entity Recognition (NER) using spaCy and Streamlit. Users can upload their own text, define custom entity labels and rules, and visualize the recognized entities with clear, colorful highlighting. This project is my first official foray into the world of natural language processing, and helps to combine my academic interests of literature and linguistics with my data science skills.  
**Skills Used:**  Python, spaCy, Streamlit  
**Repository:**  https://github.com/kmgilland/GILLAND-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/NERStreamlitApp  

### 🎁  **4. Blind Box Collector's Companion - Streamlit App**  
**Description:**  The Blind Box Collector's Companion is a Streamlit application designed to help enthusiasts of blind box figures manage their collections, track desired ("target") figures, and analyze purchasing strategies. It addresses common challenges faced by collectors, such as keeping track of owned items (including duplicates), understanding spending, and evaluating the probability of obtaining specific figures from various series.  
**Skills Used:**  Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplot, Seaborn, Streamlit   
**Repository:**  https://github.com/kmgilland/GILLAND-Python-Portfolio/tree/main/StreamlitAppFinal
